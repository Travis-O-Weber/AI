Combined README for All Files

Overview

This repository contains files related to an AI homework project, including weights for CNN and RNN models, image files for analysis, and a reference link to the project.

File Details

1. AIHW3link.txt

Description: A text file containing a Google Colab link for the AI homework project.

Link: Open Google Colab

2. cnn_weights.weights.h5

Description: Pre-trained weights for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Purpose: Image classification and related tasks.

Usage:

from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
model = load_model('cnn_weights.weights.h5')

3. rnn_weights.weights.h5

Description: Pre-trained weights for a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

Purpose: Sequential data analysis, time series forecasting, and potentially video frame processing.

Usage:

from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
model = load_model('rnn_weights.weights.h5')

4. download.png and download (1).png

Description: Image files used for model inference and testing.

Usage Example:

from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import load_img, img_to_array

img = load_img('download.png', target_size=(224, 224))
img_array = img_to_array(img) / 255.0
img_array = img_array.reshape((1, 224, 224, 3))

prediction = model.predict(img_array)
print('Prediction:', prediction)
