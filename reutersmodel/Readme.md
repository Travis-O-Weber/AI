3. cnn_weights.weights.h5

Description: Pre-trained weights for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Purpose: Image classification and related tasks.

Usage:

from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
model = load_model('cnn_weights.weights.h5')

4. rnn_weights.weights.h5

Description: Pre-trained weights for a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

Purpose: Sequential data analysis, time series forecasting, and potentially video frame processing.

Usage:

from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
model = load_model('rnn_weights.weights.h5')

5. CS3793_assignment4_abc123 (1).ipynb

Description: Jupyter notebook for Assignment 4 of CS3793.

Usage: Open in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab to view and run code cells.

6. fdp653_assignment4.zip

Description: A ZIP archive containing files related to assignment 4 of FDP653.

Usage: Extract and inspect the files for assignment details.

7. cnn_weights.weights.h5 (Uploaded Again)

Description: Another instance of the CNN weights file, possibly an updated version.

Usage:

from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
model = load_model('cnn_weights.weights.h5')

8. rnn_weights.weights.h5 (Uploaded Again)

Description: Another instance of the RNN weights file, possibly an updated version.

Usage:

from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
model = load_model('rnn_weights.weights.h5')

Requirements

Ensure the following libraries are installed:

pip install tensorflow keras h5py

Notes

Make sure the model architecture matches the saved weights.

Verify image dimensions correspond to the model's input size.

The files are part of an AI homework project related to virus spread and vaccine transportation in Texas, as seen in the accompanying images.
